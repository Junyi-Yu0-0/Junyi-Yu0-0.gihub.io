	Okay, let me introduce you the bestt player from League of Legends, his name is <a href="https://lol.gamepedia.com/Faker">faker</a>. “League of Legends” is one of the PC battle arena game, released by US video game company Riot Games in 2009. He was born and raised in South Korea, he is one of the top echelon of players in the game. His role play is mid-laner for the SK Telecom T1 team. What and why he is so good at the game? First, he don't think of himself as a prodigy, but he have some kind of “gaming sensibility”, he think that shoud have in any pro gamer. Become one of the success gamer, he is like many pro gamers, pending hours and hours for practicing. He belive being the best of you, keep trying to reach your person goal little by little you will get something out of it. Not only in game, also on person life too. “Right now, there are so many people who want to become pro gamers, but the proportion of those who end up succeeding is extremely small,” faker said. That mean a lot of people are keep trying to catching for thier dream as a gamer. For the last he also said "the World Health Organization’s move to recognize gaming addiction as a mental disorder. 'I think both side are right in their own ways. Because games are fun to play, they could cause (dangerous levels of) addiction more easily than any other sports could. I think the said problems must be corrected, while esports should continue to advance as it is. But I do realize that striking a balance is hard.' The best thing he can do as a pro gamer is 'to work hard, do well,' he said. 'I hope we can contribute to shaping more positive perceptions of gaming and esports.'”
