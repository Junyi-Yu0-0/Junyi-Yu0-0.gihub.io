	Okay, let me introduce you the best player from League of Legends, his name is <a href="https://lol.gamepedia.com/Faker">faker</a>. “League of Legends” is one of the PC battle arena game, released by US video game company Riot Games in 2009. He was born and raised in South Korea, he is one of the top echelons of players in the game. His role play is mid-laner for the SK Telecom T1 team. What and why he is so good at the game? First, he doesn't think of himself as a prodigy, but he has some kind of “gaming sensibility”, he thinks that should have in any pro gamer. Become one of the successful gamers, he is like many pro gamers, spending hours, and hours for practicing. He believes is the best of you, keep trying to reach your personal goal little by little you will get something out of it. Not only in the game, but also in personal life too. “Right now, there are so many people who want to become pro gamers, but the proportion of those who end up succeeding is extremely small,” faker said. That means a lot of people are keep trying to catching for thier dream as a gamer. For the last, he also said "the World Health Organization’s move to recognize gaming addiction as a mental disorder. 'I think both side are right in their own ways. Because games are fun to play, they could cause (dangerous levels of) addiction more easily than any other sports could. I think the said problems must be corrected, while esports should continue to advance as it is. But I do realize that striking a balance is hard.' The best thing he can do as a pro gamer is 'to work hard, do well,' he said. 'I hope we can contribute to shaping more positive perceptions of gaming and esports.'”
