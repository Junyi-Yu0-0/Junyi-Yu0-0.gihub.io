<h1>This Is About Me In College</h1>
<p>I was an Engineering student.</p>
<p>First-year of college, I got my first part-time job in school,</p>
<p>and keep going to class every day and having good grades.</p>
<p>Except for losing sleep at night by doing some of my own hobbies.</p>
 <p>The second year, My part-time job hours got raised,</p>
<p>and more works outside of class.</p>
<p>I can't keep the balance between school and job.</p>
<p>Then I take a break from school for one semester,</p>
<p>and think about what is the best path for myself.</p>
