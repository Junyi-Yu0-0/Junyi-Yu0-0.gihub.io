	On this point, you must be a pro gamer, on my this little game at least. let me introduce you to the best player from Rainbow Six Siege. His name is <a href="https://liquipedia.net/rainbowsix/Pengu">"Pengu"</a>. "Rainbow Six Siege" faces intense close-quarters combat, high lethality, and tactical game by Ubisoft in 2015. He was born and raised in the US. in order to be a pro league gamer. He has to give up almost everything for boring training just playing one game. Just try to "kill" others become a champion once per year, or get not thing out of it. Do you think is it still worth it?
