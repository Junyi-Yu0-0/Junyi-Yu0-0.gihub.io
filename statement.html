		I am Junyi Yu, and I am Chinese. When I think of the word ‘origin’ I will be thinking about the place that makes me want to become an artist, or what makes me want to be one. When I migrated to the United States, the first city I stayed in was New York, there was street art everywhere. Then I moved to San Francisco. There is so much outdoor art, for example, Hearts in San Francisco and great landscapes, for example, the Golden Gate Bridge view. None above are the main origin I want to start with. My origin started 2 years ago, with my self-built computer that has an RTX 2080 graphics card. That let me have so many great experiences with the virtual world. So I can visit “Los Santos”, to be a legal criminal, visit San Francisco by hacking the whole network system without myself walking in the street, and time travel back to world war two to be a fearless soldier. In virtual reality, you can be anyone you can’t be in real life. In my project, I will present reality with the digital world, massing with the human sensor between real and unreal. For visual angles, I will use all of them, from a first-person perspective to an overall still camera view. I will film landscapes, human emotion, virtual interaction with reality. I can’t wait to explore that new journey into the art world with digital video. Also, I can't wait to learn more skills when I am on this path of the journey. That is how I create “SF In Google Map”, and this project I will continue this kind of art in my future career. 
        
        In these two years of taking art classes, I have learned coding art in Art 74 and Art 101 class. There was a lot of debugging and function making, which has annoyed me so much. In fact, it is each time that I am overcoming each little bug I have made, that brings me to like a resurrection. That is how crazy I am in love to create artworks with coding, each time solving a bug not only makes me feel good but also actually learns something from it. Maybe that is the reason why there is everywhere in the world that says “there are no secrets to success, but learn from failure”. In the career of being an artist, we will bump into many different walls to find that only one right exit for ourselves. 
        
        However, I am just having my first step on the shoal, so I don’t have a special style or a signature of art at this point. Hopefully, I will be able to find and make one before I graduate, and that is my goal. In reality, I will continue to make more artwork not just in class, but also in my own time in order to reach that. That is my “origin” starting from here and now, and I will take on my path swim in the freedom of art.
