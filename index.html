		Before I got into BFA Admission, I am an Engineering Major Student. I was talking art class for try out, and I start in love with the pieces I have made. So now I am taking this first step more, and start taking classes on coding art and video editing. I am so enjoying each challenge I have in coding, every technical difficulty from Adobe Premiere. The success of overcoming those challenges makes me proud, just like a tough trying to run through the wall at the end he make it. Most likely, Every artwork can be reflected for a normal day in the life, whether it is a common-sense story or a little thing that we did daily. What is New Media Art? Where can we find it? The art that makes technical skills with the modem and an internet connection. We can find it every day and everywhere that has the internet, like advertising for television or web page sites. Even every game that has been published or is made now is part of the digital media art too. I can't wait to learn more in class and I am excited to have fun by making my own project or artwork. Sometimes art can explain things that words can't and that is the beauty of it all. Place enjoy the pieces, and thank you!
